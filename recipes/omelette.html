    <h2>How to make the Best Omelette Recipe?</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Dice 1 cup of vegetables.</li>
        <li>Over medium-high heat, sauté the vegetables and garlic in olive oil until soft, about 3-5 minutes depending on the vegetables you choose.</li>
        <li>Set aside.</li>

        <li>Cook bacon (or sausage), garlic, and onion over medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes).</li>
        <li>Set aside.</li>

        <li>Whisk eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout).</li>
        <li>Whisk in salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add whisked eggs and swirl the pan until they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set.</li>
        <li>Once eggs begin to set, gently push the edges in with a spatula and swirl the pan so uncooked eggs on top move to the edges.</li>
        <li>When the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese over the top of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Add the fillings on one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Fold the other half over the fillings.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
